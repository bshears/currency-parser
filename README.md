# Currency parser

Small scripts in Ruby and Python parsing HTML of website [kantor.aliorbank.pl](http://kantor.aliorbank.pl/forex/) for exchange rates. 

# How-to

NOTE: First of all, these scripts were created on Linux OS (Ubuntu).

1. You need to change location of bash/ruby/python for your machine in first line of each script file (currency_parser.rb/.py and parser_runner.sh).
2. Add execute permission to all 3 files.
3. To run type in your terminal: 

> ./parser_runner.sh

That's all. Thanks!
